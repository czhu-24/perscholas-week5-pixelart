# Module 1: Pixel Art Web App 

This web app was created using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, and the Canvas API. 

# Motivation

I wanted to make a drawing app using something that I had never used before, Canvas.

# Screenshot

# Features
- pencil tool
- eraser 
- color selector
- rectangle/square tool
- ellipse/circle tool
- eyedropper
- undo/redo actions
- color palette to get you started

# Improvements 
- Ellipse/circle tool is buggy. The switch from circle to rectangle isn't smooth and the circle isn't as responsive as I would like. Probably need to do some more geometry to finetune this. 
- The rectangle/square tool won't draw if you get to the very edge of the canvas.
- Code is so spaghetti it could legally be considered a pasta dish. ðŸ¤¡ Should have divided the js file into more module files.
- Show fireworks or confetti (didn't decide) on export button click. would use more CSS animations.
- Bucket tool was a previous stretch goal... 

# How to use?
Click on the buttons and draw on the Canvas like you might any other drawing app (Paint, Krita, etc).
